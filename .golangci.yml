# This configuration file is not a recommendation.

# We intentionally use a limited set of linters.
# This configuration file is used with different version of golangci-lint to avoid regressions:
# the linters can change between version,
# their configuration may be not compatible or their reports can be different,
# and this can break some of our tests.
# Also, some linters are not relevant for the project (e.g. linters related to SQL).
#
# We have specific constraints, so we use a specific configuration.
#
# See the file `.golangci.reference.yml` to have a list of all available configuration options.
