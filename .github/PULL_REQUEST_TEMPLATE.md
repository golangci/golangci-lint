WARNING:

We use Dependabot to update dependencies (linters included).
The updates happen at least automatically once a week (Sunday 11am UTC).

Non-versioned dependencies are managed by the golangci-lint maintainers.

No pull requests to update a linter will be accepted unless:
you are the original author of the linter, AND there are important changes required (like a major version bump).

Pull requests from a fork inside a GitHub organization are not allowed.
