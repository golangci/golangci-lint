## How do you add a custom linter?

You can integrate it yourself, see this [manual](/contributing/new-linters/).
Or you can create a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/issues/new) and we will integrate when time permits.

## How to integrate `golangci-lint` into large project with thousands of issues

We are sure that every project can easily integrate `golangci-lint`, even the large one. The idea is to not fix all existing issues. Fix only newly added issue: issues in new code. To do this setup CI to run `golangci-lint` with option `--new-from-rev=HEAD~1`. Also, take a look at option `--new`, but consider that CI scripts that generate unstaged files will make `--new` only point out issues in those files and not in the last commit. In that regard `--new-from-rev=HEAD~1` is safer.
By doing this you won't create new issues in your code and can choose fix existing issues (or not).

## How to use `golangci-lint` in CI

Run `golangci-lint` in CI and check the exit code. If it's non-zero - fail the build.

See [how to properly install `golangci-lint` in CI](/usage/install#ci-installation)

## Which Go versions are supported

The same as the Go team (the 2 last minor versions)

## `golangci-lint` doesn't work

1. Please, ensure you are using the latest binary release.
2. Run it with `-v` option and check the output.
3. If it doesn't help create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/issues/new) with the output from the error and #2 above.

## Why running with `--fast` is slow on the first run

Because the first run caches type information. All subsequent runs will be fast.
Usually this options is used during development on local machine and compilation was already performed.
