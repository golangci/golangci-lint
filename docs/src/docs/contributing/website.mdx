title: Website architecture
---

## Technology

We use [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) for static site generation because sites built with it are very fast.

This framework uses React and JavaScript/TypeScript.

## Source Code

The website lives in `docs/` directory of [golangci-lint repository](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint).

## Theme

Initially the site is based on [@rocketseat](https://github.com/jpedroschmitz/rocketdocs) theme.
Later we've merged its code into `src/@rocketseat` because we needed too much changes
and [gatsby shadowing](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/shadowing/) doesn't allow shadowing `gatsby-node.js` or `gatsby-config.js`.

## Navigation

Left menu is configured in `src/config/sidebar.yml`.

## Articles

Articles are located in `src/docs/` in `*.mdx` files. [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/gatsby) is Markdown
allowing to use `React` components.

## Templating

We use templates like `{.SomeField}` inside our `mdx` files.
There templates are expanded by running `make website_expand_templates` in the root of the repository.
It runs script `scripts/website/expand_templates/` that rewrites `mdx` files with replaced templates.

## Hosting

We use GitHub Pages as static website hosting and CD.

GitHub deploys the website to production after merging anything to a `main` branch.

## Local Testing

Install Node.js (v20 or newer).

Run:

```sh
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run start
```

And navigate to `http://localhost:8000` after successful Gatsby build.
There is no need to restart Gatsby server almost for all changes: it supports hot reload.
Also, there is no need to refresh a webpage: hot reload updates changed content on the open page.

## Website Build

To do it run:

```sh
go run ./scripts/website/expand_templates/
```
