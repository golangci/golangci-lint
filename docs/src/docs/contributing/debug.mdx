You can see a verbose output of linter by using `-v` option.

```bash
golangci-lint run -v
```

If you would like to see more detailed logs you can use the environment variable `GL_DEBUG`.
Its value is a list of debug tags.

The existing debug tags are documented in the following file: https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/blob/HEAD/pkg/logutils/logutils.go

For example:

```bash
GL_DEBUG="loader,gocritic" golangci-lint run
```

```bash
GL_DEBUG="loader,env" golangci-lint run
```
