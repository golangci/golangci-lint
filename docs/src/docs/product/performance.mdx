## Memory Usage

A trade-off between memory usage and execution time can be controlled by [`GOGC`](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime#hdr-Environment_Variables) environment variable.
Less `GOGC` values trigger garbage collection more frequently and golangci-lint consumes less memory and more CPU. Below is the trade-off table for running on this repo:

| `GOGC`          | Peak Memory, GB | Execution Time, s |
| --------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| `5`             | 1.1             | 60                |
| `10`            | 1.1             | 34                |
| `20`            | 1.3             | 25                |
| `30`            | 1.6             | 20.2              |
| `50`            | 2.0             | 17.1              |
| `80`            | 2.2             | 14.1              |
| `100` (default) | 2.2             | 13.8              |
| `off`           | 3.2             | 9.3               |

## Why `golangci-lint` is so fast

1. Work sharing

   During operation, `golangci-lint` shares work between specific linters (like `govet`, `ineffassign`, etc.).
   We don't fork to call a specific linter, but instead use its API.
   For small and medium projects 50-90% of work between linters can be reused.

   - load `[]*packages.Package` by `go/packages` once

     We load program (parsing all files and type-checking) only once for all linters. For the most of linters
     it's the most heavy operation: it takes 5 seconds on 8 kLoC repo and 11 seconds on `$GOROOT/src`.

   - build `ssa.Program` once

     Some linters (staticcheck, gosec, unparam) work on SSA representation.
     Building of this representation takes 1.5 seconds on 8 kLoC repo and 6 seconds on `$GOROOT/src`.

   - parse source code and build AST once

     Parsing one source file takes 200 us on average. Parsing of all files in `$GOROOT/src` takes 2 seconds.
     Currently we parse each file more than once because it's not the bottleneck. But we already save a lot of
     extra parsing. We're planning to parse each file only once.

   - walk files and directories once

     It takes 300-1000 ms for `$GOROOT/src`.

2. Smart linters scheduling

   We schedule linters by a special algorithm which takes estimated execution time into account. It allows
   to save 10-30% of time when one of heavy linters (e.g., staticcheck) is enabled.

3. Don't fork to run shell commands

All linters have their versions fixed with Go modules, they are built-in,
and you don't need to install them separately.
