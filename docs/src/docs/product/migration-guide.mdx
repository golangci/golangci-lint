## Migrating configuration from v1 to v2

Golangci-lint v2 has slightly different configuration options than v1.
Some options were renamed, some were moved, some were split, and some were removed.
Here is a guide how to migrate your v1 configuration.

You can use `golangci-lint` itself to migrate your configuration automatically through the `migrate` command:

```sh
golangci-lint migrate
```

In case you want to do it manually, here is a list of changes.
