To run golangci-lint execute:

```sh
golangci-lint run
```

It's an equivalent of executing:

```sh
golangci-lint run ./...
```

You can choose which directories or files to analyze:

```sh
golangci-lint run dir1 dir2/...
golangci-lint run file1.go
```

Directories are NOT analyzed recursively.
To analyze them recursively append `/...` to their path.
It's not possible to mix files and packages/directories, and files must come from the same package.

GolangCI-Lint can be used with zero configuration. By default, the following linters are enabled:

```sh
$ golangci-lint help linters
{.LintersCommandOutputEnabledOnly}
```

Pass `-E/--enable` to enable linter and `-D/--disable` to disable:

```sh
golangci-lint run --disable-all -E errcheck
```

More information about available linters can be found in the [linters page](/usage/linters/).
